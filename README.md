  <li><h3>Automation</h3>
    <p>It is absolutely no doubt very annoying for anybody to keep repeatedly perform a certain task without getting bored and tired especially
        expecially when it comes to sending bulk messages or emails to hundreds of people.Well, it quite seems very obvious that no one would
        like to linearly visit each contact and send messages about the activity and missing a cup of coffee at work.In this way <b>AUTOMATION</b>
        comes in handy to let the computer perform these repeatative tasks so that you can actually focus on other important tasks or goals which
        you really should.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Bot</h3>
  <p>A <i>Bot</i> or a <i>Robot</i> is actually powered by AI <i>(artificial intelligence)</i> or most importantly <i>Computers</i> sort of
      speak.It means that a bot or robot is actually programmed by a real human so that it keeps performing the task until final condition is
      met or reached.Similarly, if we connect these ideas and technologies,the result we get is an <i>Automated Bot.</i></p>

      <h3>Python and Selenium</h3>
      <p>You might probably hear about <b>Python</b> a very powerful and highly advanced programming language that can be used to perform
          any task with or without human interaction.Python is greatly used for <i>Data Science</i> and <i>Machine Learning</i>.It can also
          be used as a general purpose <i>backend</i> language for web application/mobo/desktop app etc.Moreover it is used
          to design and develop <i>Machine Learning Models and artificial Neural Networks</i> to let the program/software behave as much as
          human and make it real-time interactive.<b>Selenium</b> is a library with powerful functions that can be used to perform web based Automated
          tasks such as automating your Facebook/Instagram account or filling out web-based forms and etc.Selenium and Python can be together
          used together to make these tasks come in action.</p>
